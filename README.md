## Request your own USRBG
* Join this Discord Server > [Black Box](https://discord.gg/TeRQEPb), Upload your file directly into the channel. [#background-request](https://discord.com/channels/449175561529589761/645627516794699787/) and wait for approval.

**All requests are processed manually** by a select few theme developers (as of right now). You should expect to **wait a short amount of time before** your background **is added.**


## Requirements
If you are using BetterDiscord, you **MUST have a plugin by [DevilBro](https://betterdiscord.app/developer/DevilBro) running**, as **USRBG requires his [library](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/BDFDB)** for certain important data attributes. *I've been nagging zere for while to add attributes to BD natively, but for the time being this is how we have to do it.*

### 1. Importing the Database

```css
@import "//ItMeSarah.github.io/usrbg/usrbg.css";
```

This will import the USRBG database. Alone, it's simply some variables. Some of examples on how it can be utilized can be seen in the [Snippets]("ItMeSarah.github.io/UsrBGSnippet.css") folder of this repo.
